What is going to be the best approach for the minesweeper game logic? It should definitely be a class, but it will be tricky to figure out how to tell each cell how many adjacent mines there are. 

### 12/9/18

The class should have in its constructor the desired game difficulty. Harder games will have larger boards and more mines.

### 12/15/18

Finished working on game logic. That was a lot of fun to figure out. Now the challenge is to work on creating robust logic for multiplayer modes. 

### 12/17/18

Today I worked more on multiplayer modes. I implemented a choice between public and private rooms.  Starting to think I should be focusing more on the front end because the project looks messy right now.  I also need to modularize the components more for the same reason.

I ran into an annoying bug today. Can't forget to change the IP the server is running on, or else it will be very hard to debug!
