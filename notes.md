What is going to be the best approach for the minesweeper game logic? It should definitely be a class, but it will be tricky to figure out how to tell each cell how many adjacent mines there are.

The class should have in its constructor the desired game difficulty. Harder games will have larger boards and more mines.

Finished working on game logic. That was a lot of fun to figure out. Now the challenge is to work on creating robust logic for multiplayer modes.

Today I worked more on multiplayer modes. I implemented a choice between public and private rooms.  Starting to think I should be focusing more on the front end because the project looks messy right now.  I also need to modularize the components more for the same reason.
